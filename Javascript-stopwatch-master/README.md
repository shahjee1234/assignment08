# Javascript stopwatch  

This is a javascript stopwatch, based in part on [this Qunit tutorial] (https://github.com/docdis/learn-qunit) but without any jquery. It has the following functions:  

* Start/continue
* Stop/pause
* Split (record split times)
* Reset

It's not pretty, but it gets the job done.
